        <!-- Effects on Agricultural Fields Section -->
        <div class="section" id="field-effects">
            <h2>1. Effects on Agricultural Fields</h2>
            <p>Excessive use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides can lead to soil degradation. Over time, these chemicals deplete essential nutrients, reduce soil fertility, and harm beneficial organisms such as earthworms and soil bacteria, which are vital for healthy soil. The continuous use of chemicals can lead to soil compaction, reduced water retention, and increased salinity, making fields less productive and less sustainable in the long term.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Effects on Farm Products Section -->
        <div class="section" id="product-effects">
            <h2>2. Effects on Farm Products</h2>
            <p>Farm products grown with chemical fertilizers and pesticides may contain residues that can accumulate in the produce. These residues can impact the taste, texture, and nutritional quality of fruits, vegetables, and grains. Additionally, some pesticides can alter the natural growth process of plants, affecting the quality and safety of the final product that reaches the consumer.</p>

        <!-- Health Risks from Chemical Consumption Section -->
        <div class="section" id="health-risks">
            <h2>3. Health Risks of Consuming Chemical-Treated Products</h2>
            <p>Consuming products with chemical residues poses potential health risks. Prolonged exposure to pesticides and herbicides has been linked to a range of health issues, including respiratory problems, hormonal imbalances, and an increased risk of certain cancers. Children and pregnant women are especially vulnerable to the harmful effects of these chemicals. By consuming organically grown or minimally processed foods, individuals can reduce their exposure to these harmful substances.</p>
